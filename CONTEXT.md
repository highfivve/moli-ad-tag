# Context Glossary

This file is a glossary of the domain language used in `@highfivve/ad-tag` (moli).
It contains terms and their precise meanings — no implementation details.

## Terms

### Label
A string tag that may be active during an ad pipeline run. Labels come from media-query
size config, auto-detected device, geo/domain resolution, the `addLabel()` runtime API, and
the `data-labels` script attribute. Labels are immutable within a single pipeline run.

### Label Condition
A predicate over the active labels, expressed as exactly one of `labelAll` (every listed
label active), `labelAny` (at least one active), or `labelNone` (none active).

### Label-Conditioned Config Override
An alternative configuration selected when its Label Condition matches the active labels.
Overrides **fully replace** the default configuration — they do not merge field-by-field. A
config has at most one default plus an ordered list of overrides; the **first** override whose
Label Condition matches wins. If no override matches, the default configuration is used.

Applies to two kinds of configuration:

- **Module config** — entries of `ModulesConfig`. Distinct from the module *activation* gate
  (`labelCondition` on a module config), which only turns a module on or off — an override
  changes *which configuration* an active module runs with.
- **Auction-feature config** — the first-level features of the Global Auction Context
  (`frequencyCap`, `biddersDisabling`, `adRequestThrottling`, `previousBidCpms`,
  `interstitial`, `trackWinningBidder`). Auction features have no activation gate; an override
  with `enabled: false` is the way to turn a feature off for its labels. An override cannot
  exist without a default — overriding a feature that has no base configuration is not
  supported.
