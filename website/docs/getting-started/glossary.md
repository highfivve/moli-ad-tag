This section contains short explanations for all the ad tag related terms. A lot of terms are overloaded with meanings,
own expectations and definitions, so the explanations here may not apply to your understanding of a certain term.

### Device

This documentation uses _device_ synonym to _layout_. For example "This ad slot should only be visible on mobile devices"
means the same as "This ad slot should only be visible on mobile layouts".

Device does not mean any physical device category, e.g. "Samsung tablet" or "Nokia smartphone".

### Label

A _label_ is a generic identifier that can be assigned to various entities, e.g. ad slots, prebid bids or size configurations.

### Consent

This ad tag works with [TCF 2.0] only, so consent means _TCF 2.0 consent_.

[TCF 2.0]: https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20CMP%20API%20v2.md
